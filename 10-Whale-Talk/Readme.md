## General information

Codecademy instructions :
> Take a phrase like ‘turpentine and turtles’ and translate it into its “whale talk” equivalent: ‘UUEEIEEAUUEE’.
>
> There are a few simple rules for translating text to whale language:
>
> 1. There are no consonants. Only vowels excluding “y”.
> 2. The u‘s and e‘s are extra long, so we must double them in our program.
> Once we have converted text to the whale language, the result is sung slowly, as is a custom in the ocean.
>
> To accomplish this translation, we can use our knowledge of loops. Let’s get started!
