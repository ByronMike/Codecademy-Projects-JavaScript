## General information

Codecademy instructions :
> #### Overview
>
> In order to complete this project, you should have completed the first three sections of  [Introduction to JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript)  through Learn JavaScript: Functions.
>
> #### Project Goals
>
> In this project, you’ll write JavaScript functions to power a small guessing game. Your code will run in the browser instead of the terminal, and you can use your browser’s console to help you test your functions and view any syntax errors.
>
> #### Project Requirements
>
> In this project, you’ll write four functions in  **script.js**. We’ve provided some additional JavaScript code in  **game.js**  that will call your functions based on user interactions, but you don’t need to look at  **game.js**  and shouldn’t edit it if you want your project to work as intended. As you complete this project, make sure that all of your functions are named exactly as specified within these tasks so that they can be called correctly when the game is played. In this project, your JavaScript functions are incorporated into a website that also uses HTML/CSS. You’ll learn more about how to do this from scratch as you continue your JavaScript journey. Explore the  [completed version](https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/independent-practice-projects/number-guesser/example/index.html)  of the project to get a sense of what you’ll be building.

>#### Setup Instructions
>
>If you choose to do this project on your computer instead of Codecademy, you can download what you’ll need by clicking the “Download” button below. You’ll need to open and work in  **script.js**  in a text editor, and open  **index.html**  in a browser to test your code. If you need help setting up on your own computer, read our  [article about setting up a text editor for web development](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/visual-studio-code).
