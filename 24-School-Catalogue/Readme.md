## General information

Codecademy instructions :
> Let’s put your knowledge of classes to the test by creating a digital school catalog for the New York City Department of Education. The Department of Education wants the catalog to hold quick reference material for each school in the city.
> 
> We need to create classes for primary and high schools. Because these classes share properties and methods, each will inherit from a parent  `School`  class. Our parent and three child classes have the following properties, getters, setters, and methods:
> 
> #### School
> 
> -   **Properties**:  `name`  (string),  `level`  (one of three strings:  `'primary'`,  `'middle'`, or  `'high'`), and  `numberOfStudents`  (number)
> -   **Getters**: all properties have getters
> -   **Setters**: the  `numberOfStudents`  property has a setter
> -   **Methods**:  `.quickFacts()`  and  `.pickSubstituteTeacher()`  (this is a static method)
> 
> #### Primary
> 
> -   Includes everything in the  `School`  class, plus one additional property
> -   **Properties**:  `pickupPolicy`  (string)
> 
> #### Middle
> 
> -   Does not include any additional properties or methods
> 
> #### High
> 
> -   Includes everything in the  `School`  class, plus one additional property
> -   **Properties**:  `sportsTeams`  (array of strings)
> 
> If you’re looking for a challenge, create the  `constructor()`  and getters for the four classes above. Then, use the setter and methods specifications in steps five, six, and seven to finish the project.
