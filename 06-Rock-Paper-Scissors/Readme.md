## General information

Codecademy instructions :
> Deep in his mountain-side meteorology lab, the mad scientist Kelvin has mastered weather prediction. Recently, Kelvin began publishing his weather forecasts on his website. However there’s a problem: All of his forecasts describe the temperature in Kelvin. \
\
With our knowledge of JavaScript, let’s convert Kelvin to Celsius, then to Fahrenheit. For example, 283 K converts to 10 °C which converts to 50 °F.
